    The script is run from the python console with the following commands
    
    # Start Script
    
    run particle_analysis.py

    # Data Import

    data_identifier = get_data() 
    
    change identifier to something that identifies the dataset, like a device + date e.g.: cpc_20240515
    imports one file at a time as dictionary
    choose input prompt according to the used device and the desired data possible prompts are displayed in console
    
    # Typical Calculations
    
    ## For Distributions:
    
    Dist.typical_calculations(data_identifier);
    
    calculates the concentration, median diameter and geometrical standard deviation of a measurement
    
    ## For Concentrations:
    
    Conc.typical_calculations(data_identifier);
    
    calculates the mean concentration of a measurement
    
    # Save Calculated Values to XLSX       
   
    save_data_to_xlsx(data_identifier, fileaddition="particleDF")
    
    # Distribution-specific Functions
    
    ## Data Selection
    
    sel_data_identifier = Dist.select_data(data_identifier, [scan_nrs]) 
    
    creates a new dictionary from the parent to sort the needed measurements and get rid of failes scans for 
    calculating a mean
    enter scan_nrs manually in a list, or as range
    Dist.typical_calculations has to be run for the selected array again
    print(f"selected scan_nrs: {scan_nrs}") to have them documented in console

    ## Calculation of Volume and Mass Distributions
    
    density = 1  # in g/cm^3
    data["Cv"] = Dist.volume_dist(data["X"], data["Cn"])
    data["Cm"] = Dist.mass_dist(data["Cv"], density)
    print(f"Mass Distribution with Density = {density} g/cm^3 calculated.") 

    ## Cut Size Distribution
    
    lowerbound = 100 #in the unit, the size data are saved by the instrument e.g. nm
    upperbound = 350
    cut_nrs = [1, 5, 7, 15]
    data_identifier = Dist.cut_dist(data_identifier, lowerbound, upperbound, scan_nrs, used_C="Cn")
    
    Allows to cut specific measurements to a more narrow size region, usually selected data should be used, but also 
    normal data can be used

    ## Calculate Mean Distributions
    
    nr_mean = 3
    mean_data = Dist.mean_of_n(data_identifier, nr_mean)
    print(f"mean of: {nr_mean} calculated")
    
    Calculates the mean distribution of n measurements. Measurements have to be in direct succession, so in normal cases
    measurements have to be selected first to bring the desired measurements in the right order and remove outliers

    ## Calculation of Geometric Parameters
    
    data_identifier["dg", "sigma_g"] = Dist.calc_geometry(data_identifier["X"], data_identifier["Cn"],
        data_identifier["calc_conc_n"], data_identifier["dX"])
    
    Calculation the geometrical mean and the geometrical standard deviation. Is called in "typical_calculations", so
    calling it on its own is not usually necessary. Also works for selected data. In mean data, the dg and sigma are
    calculated from the values given in the selected data set
    
    ## Calculation of cumulative distribution
    
    data_identifier["cumC"] = cumulative_distribution(data_identifier["Cn"])
    data_identifier["X10"], data_identifier["X16"], data_identifier["X50"], data_identifier["X84"], 
        data_identifier["X90"] = Dist.cumulative_diameters(data_identifier["X"], data_identifier["cumC"]
    
    calculated the cumulative distributions and the particle diameters below which 10, 16, 50, 84 and 90 % of all 
    particles are

    ## plotting of data -> has to be adjustet to allow for different data to be plotted
    
    ### plot normal distributions (no mean)
    
    scan_nrs = [1, 5, 7, 15]  # or list(range(1, 7))
    print(f"Plotted scan numbers: {scan_nrs}")
    ax = Dist.plot_singledata(data_identifier, scan_nrs)

    ### plot mean data
    
    ax = Dist.plot_meandata(mean_data_identifier, scan_nrs)
    
    neads a mean array created before, plots mean scans from it
    
    ### plot cumulative data
    
    ax = Dist.plot_cummdata(data_identifier, used_device, scan nrs)
    
    # Concentration specific calls
    
    ## cut time of measurement
    
    cut_time(data_identifier, scan_nrs, start, end)
    
    start and end are times in s of the measurements
    new column with ["cut_Cn"] is created
    
    ## plotting of data
    
    ### plot normal data
    
    ax = plot_fulldata(data_identifier, scan_nrs)
    
    ### plot cut data
    
    ax = plot_cutdata(data_identifier, scan_nrs)

    # Other Calls
    
    ## Calculate Mean and Std of whatever
    
    x_mean, x_std = mean_and_std(sel_data["dg"][:])

    ## Copy without Overwriting
    
    from copy import deepcopy
    dict_copy = deepcopy(dict) 
    
    gives flat copy that does not change original when changing copy

    ## If plot does not display
    
    plt.ioff()
    plt.show()

    ## Save and load session
    ### Save
    
    save_session()
    
    ### Load
    load_session()
