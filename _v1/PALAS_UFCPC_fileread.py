PALAS_UFCPC_fileread.py

Script for Data import of the PALAS UFCPC

Created v0 2022-03-10 to 2022-04-04
@written by Kevin Maier (kevin.r.maier@tum.de)

2022-10-17: transferred to gitlab, old versioning was removed, so all referenced files ..._vX were renamed without
    version number

2024-06 to 2025-11 updated to provide data of structure as used in particle_analysis.py

Works by assigning a scan number to a set of measured data points based on the change in comment set during saving of
the data
