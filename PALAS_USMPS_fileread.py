Import of Data and Plot
@edited by Kevin Maier (kevin.r.maier@tum.de)

2020-10-xx: labels plot with comment from txt instead of timestamp
2020-11-14: created functions from previous script as "import_data" and "plot_data"
2020-11-17: added tkinter
2022-01-14-16: redid import function for later using it with one SMPS_analysis file
2022-10-17: transferred to gitlab, old versioning was removed, so all referenced files ..._vX were renamed without
    version number
2023-01-19: filename is retrieved from SMPS_analysis now
