TSI_SMPS3071_fileread.py

Script for Data Evaluation of the TSI SMPS consisting of Classifier 3071, DMA 3081 and CPC 3775
Data has to be exported in rows

Created 2021-10-22 - 2021-10-26
@written by Kevin Maier (kevin.r.maier@tum.de)
2021-11-17: title of the produced figures now in two lines, added concentration to be extracted, averaged, printed
2022-01-18: started to modify it, to work with SMPS_analysis_v0 -> continue this later on, shifted dX from
                plot to extract function, changed mean_of_3 to mean of n, which was ez
2022-03-03: reworked it, so it can be used as import filter for SMPS_analysis_v0 -> removed all doubly functions
                now gives X, dX, Cn and time as newSMPS_fileread_v4.py
2022-10-17: transferred to gitlab, old versioning was removed, so all referenced files ..._vX were renamed without
    version number
2023-01-19: filename is retrieved from SMPS_analysis now
