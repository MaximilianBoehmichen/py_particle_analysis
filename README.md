# Pypana

A Python package for importing, analyzing, and plotting aerosol measurements.

pypana reads the raw output of many aerosol measurement instruments into one consistent data model, 
to easily compute, modify, and derive statistics for publication-ready plots. And all of that without writing instrument-specific code.

## Installation

```bash
# pip
pip install pypana

# uv
uv add pypana

# conda
conda install -c conda-forge pypana
```

## Quick example

Read a file (the instrument format is detected automatically among all supported instruments), and overlay several measurements in a single number-distribution histogram:

```python
from pypana.config import settings
from pypana.plots.histograms.hist_matrix import STANDARD_HIST_SINGLE_KWARGS
from pypana.plots.themes.ibm import IBMTheme
from pypana.readers import SmartReader

# set one of the ready-to-use themes as default
settings.THEME = IBMTheme
settings.THEME.set_mode("light")

# load the data from the instrument's output file
data = SmartReader("../ExampleFiles/20250822_PALAS_WELAS.txt").read()

# overlay scans 2-5 in one histogram of the number distribution (dN)
data.histogram(
    (2, 3, 4, 5),
    "dN",
    title="Histogram of four measurements",
    **STANDARD_HIST_SINGLE_KWARGS,
)
```

## Documentation

Tutorials and API references are available at <TODO ADD LINK>.

To get started with pypana, we suggest starting with these tutorials:
<TODO ADD LINK TO HIST AND DATA MANIPULATION>

Example measurement files for some supported instrument are in `ExampleFiles/`

## Readers

The following table lists the currently supported readers. If a certain aerosol-measurement-instrument is not listed here, you can either open an [issue](https://github.com/Haisch-Group/pypana/issues), or implement it yourself, so you can profit from the already implemented analysis features of the `InstrumentData` datastructure.
