"""
Script for Data Evaluation of the TSI SMPS consisting of Classifier 3071, DMA 3081 and CPC 3775
Data has to be exported in rows and plot is written, so that it displays the dW/logDp
Mean and std of three consecutive measurements is calculated, so triplicates should be measured

Created v0 2021-10-22 - 2021-10-26
v1 2021-11-17: title of the produced figures now in two lines, added concentration to be extracted, averaged, printed
v2 2022-01-18: started to modify it, to work with SMPS_analysis_v0 -> continue this later on, shifted bar_width from
                plot to extract function, changed mean_of_3 to mean of n, which was ez
v3 2022-03-03: reworked it, so it can be used as import filter for SMPS_analysis_v0 -> removed all doubly functions
                now gives X, bar_width, Cn and time as newSMPS_fileread_v4.py
