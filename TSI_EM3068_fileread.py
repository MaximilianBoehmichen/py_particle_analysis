TSI_EM3068_fileread.py

Script for Data Evaluation of the TSI EM 3068 Data acquired via NI-Card and Self-Written Labview Script
The electrometer has a noise current of 1x10^15 ampere according to the manual (and i think there should be a - in the
power)
The output voltage is in a range of 0-10 volts, which correspond to a current of 0-10 picoampere
